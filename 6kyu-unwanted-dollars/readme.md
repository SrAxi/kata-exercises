# Unwanted dollars
Solving a codewars kata for removing the `$` sign from inputs and returning a valid number

-------

## Description:
We need a simple function that converts a string representing a number (possibly with a $ sign in front of it) into the number itself.

Remember to consider negative numbers (the - sign may come either before or after the $ sign, if there is one), and any extraneous space characters (leading, trailing, or around the $ sign) that the users might put in. You do not need to handle trailing characters other than spaces (e.g. "1.2 3"). If the given string does not represent a number, (either with or without a $ sign), return 0.0 .

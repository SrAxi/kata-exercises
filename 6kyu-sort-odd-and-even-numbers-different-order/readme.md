-------

## Description:
You are given an array of integers. Your task is to sort odd numbers within the array in ascending order, and even numbers in descending order.

Note that zero is an even number. If you have an empty array, you need to return it.

The input index should have the same type of number in output. If input index is even, output index should be ordered even.


## Some Examples
```javascript
[5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 4]  -->  [1, 3, 8, 4, 5, 2]

odd numbers ascending:   [1, 3,       5   ]
even numbers descending: [      8, 4,    2]
```

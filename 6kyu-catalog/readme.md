Solving a codewars kata for handling a multi line string in a catalog context

https://www.codewars.com/kata/catalog


-------

## Description:
Given a multi line string the `function catalog(s, "saw")` returns the line(s) corresponding to the article with `$` before the prices.


## Notes:
- There is a blank line between two lines of the catalog.
- The same article may appear more than once. If that happens return all the lines concerned by the article (in the same order as in the catalog).
- The line separator of results may depend on the language `\n` or `\r\n`. You can see examples in the "Sample tests".
